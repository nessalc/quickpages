# Quickpages

A quick way for me to publish static web pages. By default GitHub Pages use Jekyll, but I didn't feel like doing that, so I told it not to.

So here's the "full" index of the pages I've created so far. They may or may not work, and they're almost certainly not "complete" in any sense of that word.

- [Index](index.html)
  - an index of pages (much like this)
- [Planets Data](planetsdata.html)
  - calls to an API (currently offline) displaying data on planets (plus Pluto, and the Earth's moon) in our solar system
- [Résumé](resume.html)
  - a résumé of sorts, and also a way for me to "structure" filling holes in the gaps of my own knowledge
