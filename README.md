# Quickpages

A quick way for me to publish static web pages. I decided to switch things to Jekyll, but a couple of pages I created beforehand I left alone.

I will probably use this as a blog for a bit unless or until I come up with something else. Long ago I lost track of the number of blogs I've set up and subsequently lost due to hard drive crashes, forgetting to back it up before the ol' `fdisk format reinstall` dance, and random server mishaps or misconfigurations. So my title is "Take ℵ₀" as just a tad hyperbolic.

- [Index](index.html)
  - an index of pages (much like this)
- [Planets Data](planetsdata.html)
  - calls to an API (currently offline) displaying data on planets (plus Pluto, and the Earth's moon) in our solar system
- [Résumé](resume.html)
  - a résumé of sorts, and also a way for me to "structure" filling holes in the gaps of my own knowledge
