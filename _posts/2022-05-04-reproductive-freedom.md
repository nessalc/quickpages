Regarding the (leaked) *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org* draft opinion, which effectively overrules *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* and torpedoes the long-standing legal norm of *stare decisis*, I offer my own outrage, screaming into the void, because this needs to get out somewhere...

Yes, I'm another (mostly[^1]) cis-het-white-able-bodied-male[^2] expressing an opinion on something I really have no business in, but that's a big part of the problem! What's the common denominator between Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch? All straight white cis-gender men. Roberts hasn't "pledged" his vote like those four and Amy Coney Barrett, but he's strongly signalled in the past that he'll at least join in the opinion of the majority.

Maybe someday I'll write a more researched treatise on the bases of my opinions, the history of this, but a) that's not likely and b) now is the time for hot takes.

First, a majority (albeit a slim one of ~58%) of people in the US are pro-choice. In that same poll, just 16% were for completely banning abortion[^3]. 54% were for upholding *Roe* and 28% were for overturning that precedent. Yet when *this* decision gains the force of law, abortion will be illegal in most cases in 13 states due to laws that were designed to "trigger", or take effect, if/when *Roe* was overturned. Now that this has happened, Based on the other states that either have laws on the books already restricting or banning abortion, 32 states and territories in total will be able to enforce these laws: Alabama, American Samoa, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Guam, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, MIssissippi, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wyoming, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconson. It'll only be protected and/or legal in Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.

The opinion of a vocal minority (we're talking those 16%, and in some cases less) believe that "it's a person at fertilization". If these people were consistent, their efforts might be better spent in the scientific field to figure out why somewhere between 30% and 60% of fertilized eggs don't implant on the uterine wall (and therefore "die"). Another way to prevent abortion is to have comprehensive sex education and readily-available contraception. Maybe fund childcare for those single parents who can't otherwise afford to carry a child to term?

## This decision will kill people

That's not hyperbole. Pregnancy is dangerous. The US already has among the highest maternal mortality rate of developed countries, and that's been going up consistently for the past 20 years.[^5] We're right up there with Suriname, Guyana, and Serbia.[^4] 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, and 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births for African-Americans.[^6] The few fortunate people who will be able to get an abortion after this takes effect will be those with means (in other words, money). To procure an abortion already (which, in most cases, is two visits to a doctor's office to take a pill), the parent has to take time off work, often obtain child care, find transportation to the clinic (which again, already, can be hundreds of miles away), and in some cases go through a mandatory waiting period after being forced to listen to factually incorrect information regarding the "risks" of abortion. Low-income parents often can't afford to take time off work as they may already be deciding whether to eat or pay rent. If they're forced to carry the child to term, they're likely to feed the children, but will have to take on another job or wind up living in their car or on the street.

If any parent desires to have a child, they have to be in an economic situation which will allow them to take time off work for prenatal and neonatal doctors' appointments and to pay for child care. If that parent is flipping burgers or mopping floors, they are unlikely to have comprehensive health care benefits through their employer, and may not be able to afford either. Forget maternity leave--if they aren't working, they aren't putting food on the table unless they're sneaking the customer's leftovers into a bag, for which they could get fired (if not sick). If they work at a desk at a multinational conglomorate or bucking rivets as a union member, they *may* be able to cover that.
