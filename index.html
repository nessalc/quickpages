        <p>Yes, I've made a million of these things. I'm making another one. Will I ever stick to it? No idea. Probably not. Whatever.</p>

        <p>This is what I hope becomes something solid.</p>
        <p>The basic idea: court decisions and other noteworthy documents in a handful of easily parseable formats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The original, probably a link to the court's website. As this is likely a PDF, features the rest of this site should have will not be available.</li>
            <li>A copy in HTML, with additions
                <ul>
                    <li>Links from footnotes and internal citations directly to the opinions being referenced, if available</li>
                    <li>Commentary from yours truly, and possibly some guests, if it ever gets to be something.</li>
                    <li>Stylesheets and theming available so you can read the opinion with your favorite font (yes, I know you font-nerds are out there)</li>
                    <li>These stylesheets can also hide inline citations and commentary to make the decision read more like prose</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Links to relevant associated information, like amicus briefs, exhibits, other filings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I do plan for this to be US-focused and left-leaning, but the court data is public domain, and if you get it from me, I can't prove you didn't do the work yourself. Commentary would fall under a copyright or copyleft of the author, as chosen by that individual, and will be noted near said commentary.</p>
        <p>This will also serve as advocacy for a replacement for the scam known as <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/20/pacer-court-records-225821/">PACER</a>. The Internet Archive and others have <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/02/13/internet-archive-offers-to-host-pacer-data/">begged Congress</a> to make the data more accessible, but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears. Or greedy ones.</p>
        <p>The inaugural post/page will be about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_U.S._Department_of_Justice_resignations">Valentine's Day Seven</a>.</p>
        <h3>Bingo Generator</h3>
        <p>My wife and I have a little, through <a href="https://www.bbbs.org">Big Brothers Big Sisters</a> that we do something with every couple of weeks. However, he lives a modest distance from our house, and subsequently, to many of the places we take him. My wife found some "road trip bingo" cards, but they are severely lacking. Bingo shouldn't be a matter of who saw it and marked it <em>first</em> with cards that are identical, but the "random chance" that the objects on your card line up.</p>
        <p>I'd like to start with a general bingo generator, to create standard cards, with the ability to configure say, the size of the cells, the font used, the text of the free space, etc.</p>
        <p>The "object bingo" is a bit harder. The images should be public domain or CC, probably without the ND bit, at least if they're in a public library of images. They should be categorized, so you could create a "farm" bingo with separate cells for, say, cow, pig, chicken, sheep, windmill, combine, etc., or, on the other end of the spectrum for a more generic card, use "farm" or "livestock" as an entire cell. The ability to customize the objects allows the user to say, these are objects we're likely to have in the area. Here in Kansas, "mountains" aren't exactly a common sight, but they are on one of the bingo cards we have. And while we do have a number of wind farms with wind turbines, windmills and oil pumpjacks are far more common.</p>
