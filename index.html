        <h1>Nessalc's Qucikpages</h1>
        <p>Yes, I've made a million of these things. I'm making another one. Will I ever stick to it? No idea. Probably not. Whatever.</p>
        <h2>Sections</h2>
        <h3><a href="dissent/">I Dissent</a></h3>
        <p>This is what I hope becomes something solid.</p>
        <p>The basic idea: court decisions and other noteworthy documents in a handful of easily parseable formats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The original, probably a link to the court's website. As this is likely a PDF, features the rest of this site should have will not be available.</li>
            <li>A copy in HTML, with additions
                <ul>
                    <li>Links from footnotes and internal citations directly to the opinions being referenced, if available</li>
                    <li>Commentary from yours truly, and possibly some guests, if it ever gets to be something.</li>
                    <li>Stylesheets and theming available so you can read the opinion with your favorite font (yes, I know you font-nerds are out there)</li>
                    <li>These stylesheets can also hide inline citations and commentary to make the decision read more like prose</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Links to relevant associated information, like amicus briefs, exhibits, other filings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I do plan for this to be US-focused and left-leaning, but the court data is public domain, and if you get it from me, I can't prove you didn't do the work yourself. Commentary would fall under a copyright or copyleft of the author, as chosen by that individual, and will be noted near said commentary.</p>
        <p>This will also serve as advocacy for a replacement for the scam known as <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/20/pacer-court-records-225821/">PACER</a>. The Internet Archive and others have <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/02/13/internet-archive-offers-to-host-pacer-data/">begged Congress</a> to make the data more accessible, but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears. Or greedy ones.</p>
        <p>The inaugural post/page will be about the <a href="https://dnyuz.com/2025/02/14/the-valentines-day-seven/">Valentine's Day Seven</a> (I'll try to find a link I expect to be more permanent and don't expect a paywall).</p>
